## It feels so good to be back...

For the longest time, I've been thinking about (re)(re)(re)(...)taking writing/blogging, but every time I start, "something" comes up that makes me shift my attention, and writing takes a back seat. Clearly, that's no longer the case, otherwise neither this post, nor this blog would have seen the light of day.

My mind[^1] has been processing why that's the case and why writing is actually an essential practice to someone like myself.

## Why does writing always take a back seat?

I won't insult your intelligence by giving you the layered[^2] reasons, instead I'll just share the real thing. Without further ado:

1. Despite having the baggage, **I don't believe I have the qualifications** to talk about most of the things I think about (web dev, entrepreneurship, etc...). My mouth is basically writing checks that my body (of work) can't check.
2. When I was younger I used to say that **perfectionism** was my biggest weakness (with a pretentious smirk ofc), well, I'm glad to say that's it's no longer a weakness... As it upgraded to a defect! Ha.
3. I'm an idiot. More on this in a minute.

Now if you look more closely to these reasons, you can deduce they all share the same root: perfectionism. Debilitating perfectionism.

## So, what am I doing to deal with it and why do I have to?

### How I decided to deal with it

Remember that one of the cited reasons is yours truly being an idiot -- a very valid and a real reason, not one stemming from a feeling of insecurity.

I almost always forget about the context, meaning, I forget to ask these 2 questions: **who am I writing for** and **what is the intent behind the writing**?

The answer is plainly simple: I should be writing for myself not to teach or preach but to increase my own (mental) reach. 

### Why do I have to do it?

For one reason: The quality of thinking and communicating is proportional to the quality of writing. The better one gets at writing, the better they get at both thinking and communicating. And as both a dev and an entrepreneur (both at heart and on paper), these qualities are what makes the difference.

## What now then?

This practically means, I'll be pushing myself to write with no (internal) regard for the "quality" of my writing: If it's shit... It's shit. Over time, it'll get better. Or not. I don't know. One thing's for sure: I'll be writing more.

[^1]: The reason why I say "My mind" and not "I" here is because it's more of a background-task type of thinking, something that's been fermenting in the back of my mind for a while, for which I now have the signal that it's ready to be shared/exposed to the outer world. 
[^2]: In doing the "5 whys" exercice, you realize that with every why, a layer is peeled, revealing a deeper one.
